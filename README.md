  ## Description
  
  This is a command line application for a user who is a manager that wants to create a attractive and useful summary of their team including details about each team member and clickable links to send an email or view a GitHub account. It uses the npm package Inquirer in the command line to allow the user to input all of the team information step-by-step. The user has the option to keep adding as many engineers or interns to their team profile as they need, then they can choose "finish building my team" to exit the application. An HTML file is generated and saved in a distributable directory with a css style sheet.
